# Narmail
Narmail is an open-source reddit inbox client for Windows 10 that allows you access to your reddit messages whilst you're on the go. You can compose, reply and even message sub-reddits, all from within Narmail.

#### About
The original Narmail app was released in July 2015 for Windows Phone 8.1 and whilst it still does the job perfectly fine it's time for an update. However I want to do things differently this time and allow the community to contribute to the app with bug fixes and improvements.

#### Development
Narmail for Windows 10 is still in the very early stages of development but feel free to suggest improvements, features or even do some developments of your own.
